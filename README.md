## What does it do?

This is just a small console application, that runs a text based animation in your Terminal.

The character has an idle animation and randomly changes to other animations.

## Why should I use it?

There is not really a point in using it.
This is just a little funny site project, that I did.

But if you want to have a cute animation in your Terminal, you can try it.
