## What is Blob?

Blob is the name of the cute alien.

## What does it do

This is just a small console applikation, that runs a text based animation in your Terminal.

The character has an idle animation and randomly changes to other animations.

## Why should I use it

There is not really a point in using it.
This is just a little funny site project, that I did.

But if you want to have a cute animation in your Terminal, you can try it.

**If you like it, give me some feedback. Maybe I will add some new animations in the future.**
